You are a senior product designer + frontend architect. 
Build a complete FRONTEND-ONLY Islamic app (Ramadan-first) targeted for Bangladesh, accessible to all literacy levels.

GOALS
- Extremely simple UX for all ages (including elderly)
- Bengali-first interface with optional English
- Offline-first UI (cache indicators, graceful empty states)
- Low-data mode and lightweight design
- No backend implementation; use local mock JSON and local storage for user preferences

TECH STACK (choose one and stick to it)
- Option A: React + Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Option B: React (Vite) + TypeScript + Tailwind
(Use shadcn/ui components if React. If not available, implement clean components yourself.)

DELIVERABLES (must output all)
1) Product Requirement Document (PRD)
   - Problem statement (Bangladesh Ramadan use cases)
   - Target personas (e.g., senior user, student, busy worker, new Muslim learner)
   - Core value proposition
   - Feature list with priorities (P0/P1/P2)
   - Non-goals (backend, real notifications, real location services)
   - Accessibility & localization requirements (Bangla, big fonts)

2) Information Architecture
   - Tab navigation (max 5 tabs)
   - Screen list + short description per screen
   - User flows:
     a) First open onboarding -> select city -> Ramadan dashboard
     b) Open Quran -> search -> bookmark -> continue reading
     c) Zakat calculator -> save result -> monthly charity goal
     d) Dua -> play audio -> add favorite

3) UX Writing (Bangla-first)
   - Provide Bangla microcopy for headings/buttons/errors
   - Tone: respectful, simple, non-preachy
   - Include “Senior Mode” wording

4) UI Design System
   - Typography scale (include big font mode)
   - Spacing rules, button sizes (thumb-friendly)
   - Color guidance (high contrast, night mode)
   - Component list:
     - App shell, header, tabs
     - Prayer time card
     - Ramadan countdown card
     - Checklist
     - Quran reader (ayah blocks)
     - Audio player bar
     - Search box + filter chips
     - Zakat calculator form
     - Settings toggles
     - Empty/loading/error states
   - Iconography guidelines

5) Data Models (mock only)
   - Provide mock JSON schemas for:
     - Cities & prayer/iftar/sehri times (sample)
     - Quran surah list, ayah objects (sample)
     - Dua objects (category, arabic, bangla, audioUrl)
     - User preferences (city, language, fontSize, lowDataMode)
     - Bookmarks & favorites

6) Frontend Architecture
   - Folder structure
   - Routing map
   - State management approach (simple: context/local storage)
   - Offline caching strategy (frontend only explanation)
   - Performance approach for low-end Android devices (list techniques)
   - Localization approach (i18n keys example for Bangla/English)

7) Implementation Plan (Frontend-only)
   - Milestones (Week 1/2/3 style)
   - Screen-by-screen checklist
   - QA checklist (Bangla rendering, big fonts, slow device)

8) Produce the actual UI code scaffold
   - Create pages/screens with dummy data and components
   - Responsive mobile-first
   - Include Settings page with:
     - Language toggle (বাংলা/English)
     - Font size (Normal/Large/Extra Large)
     - Senior mode toggle
     - Low data mode toggle
     - City selector
   - Include Ramadan Dashboard page with:
     - Sehri ends / Iftar time for selected city
     - Dua buttons (niyat/iftar)
     - Amal checklist with local persistence
     - Quick links to Quran, Dua, Zakat
   - Include Quran Reader page:
     - Surah list, open surah, ayah blocks with bangla meaning
     - Bookmark and last-read persistence
   - Include Prayer Times page:
     - Daily times list, highlight current/next
   - Include Zakat Calculator page:
     - Input fields in BDT + gold/silver option
     - Result summary UI and save
   - Include Dua Library page:
     - Categories, search, favorites, audio player UI

CONSTRAINTS
- No backend, no real push notifications, no real GPS calls; provide UI only with mocked selectors.
- Must be usable offline with cached mock data and local storage.
- Keep navigation super simple and Bangla-first.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Start with PRD
- Then IA, User flows, Copy, Design System, Data models
- Then Frontend architecture
- Then Implementation plan
- Then provide code (complete project structure + key files).
